      I currently study at NUS &#127480;&#127468;, where I've been Teaching
      Assistant for Level-2 undergrad CS classes
      <b>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</b>
      and
      <b>Programming Methodology 2.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      My ambition is to make fast and reliable software that helps people enjoy
      modern software without needing modern hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Towards this goal, I've been honing my skills by coding in Rust, a
      memory-safe language, with a focus on efficiency:

      I also explore other languages to keep my perspective open. Finding out
      about built-in features and coding styles of other languages help reaffirm
      and complement what I'm writing in my main language:
