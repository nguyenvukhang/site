Over the years I've always felt the need to journal my progress in the vast
field of mathematics. When I started out in middle/high school I could still
vaguely remember which theorems I've proved and how, and that helped me navigate
homework problems with confidence. But as I move on to university, new proofs
appear all day every day and each result feels less and less memorable. Yet, I
had to somehow remember all of them, lest I'll start doubting claims and spiral
into a string of googles trying to figure out why it is true.

I had a few key criteria in mind as I chose the medium to write my textbook:

1. **Navigatable**. I like it when a set of notes directs you easily to where
   you need to find information. It mildly annoys me when the author says things
   like "Clearly, &lt;statement&gt;" but it's not clear to me why
   "&lt;statement&gt;" is true and I have to search every preceding page for a
   justification.
2. **Scalable**. As I write, the deployed size of the notes should scale
   reasonably with the content. I've tried writing with
   Markdown+[MathJax][mathjax] deployed to a static site before, but MathJax
   scales terribly with content. Not to mention it eats compute just rendering
   on client-side.
3. **Math type support**. I want to be able to write anything and everything
   that math can express without a worry about typesetting support. Clearly, the
   best choice on this particular metric is to write LaTeX directly, but it
   (used to) fly directly against the next point.
4. **Easy to write more**. I want to be able to easily add content to whatever
   current state the notes is in. It helps that the content is in a simple
   markup language, such as Markdown.
5. **Reproducible**. I want to open-source this set of notes eventually, and so
   I want them to be as future-proof as possible. Deploying on a static site
   with any modern JavaScript framework is a little too risky to me in this
   regard. Moreover, if someone wants to download a local copy of the notes,
   they'd have to run their own server and browse the notes on that.

And so I present, after many failed iterations of the same idea, the math
textbook I proudly call [minimath][minimath].
