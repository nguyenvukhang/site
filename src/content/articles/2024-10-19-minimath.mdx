# Prelude

I've always felt the need to journal my progress in the vast field of
mathematics. Back in middle/high school, I could still vaguely remember which
theorems I've proved and how, and that helped me navigate homework problems with
confidence. But as I moved on to university, new proofs appeared all day every
day and each result feels less and less memorable. Yet, I had to somehow
remember all of them, lest I'll start doubting claims and spiral into a string
of googles trying to figure out why they were true.

The solution seems pretty straightforward: to keep a set of notes that will help
me find things quickly and avoid the situation where I'm desperately trying to
remember what I googled two weeks ago.

But what form should my notes take? Handwritten? LaTeX? Pandoc or some mix of
Markdown and TeX? Should it be deployed on a website? After much consideration,
these are the key criteria I had for the medium for my notes:

1. <b id="navigatable">Navigatable</b>. I like it when it's effortless to find
   specific bits of information in a set notes. It mildly bothers me to have to
   endure extra mental overhead, especially when it's avoidable.
   - If Theorem 9 and it references Theorem 4, I would prefer to jump straight
     to Theorem 4 than to scroll. Worse still, if Theorem 4 references Theorem
     1, I'd have to scroll again _and_ remember that I have to eventually get
     back to Theorem 9. Ideally, this should be addressed.
   - When textbook authors write things like "Clearly, &lt;statement&gt;" but
     it's not clear to me why "&lt;statement&gt;" is true, there's no knowing
     where in the book the justification was made. It could be anywhere from the
     start up until that point. I've lost so much time running those linear
     searches.

2. <b id="reproducible">Reproducible</b>. I want to open-source these notes
   eventually, and so they have to be as future-proof as possible. Deploying on
   a static site with any modern JavaScript framework is too risky in this
   regard. Moreover, if someone wants to view a copy of the notes locally,
   they'd have to run their own server and browse the notes on that.

3. **Scalable**. As I write, the deployed size of the notes should scale
   reasonably with the content. I've tried writing with
   Markdown+[MathJax][mathjax] deployed to a static site before, but MathJax
   scales terribly with content (linearly, with a high coefficient). Not to
   mention it eats compute just rendering on client-side.

4. **Math type support**. I want to be able to write anything and everything
   that math can express without a worry about typesetting support. Moreover, I
   want the typeset math to be as aesthetic as possible. On the web, there's
   only [MathJax][mathjax] against [KaTeX][katex] (and maybe MathML), and
   MathJax would edge out KaTeX on this metric. Overall, the best choice is
   still to write LaTeX directly, but it (used to) fly directly against the next
   point.

5. **Easy to write more**. I want to always be able to easily add content. No
   matter how big the project becomes, I would like to just be able to drop in
   an continue writing. It helps that the content is in a simple markup
   language, such as Markdown.

And so I present, after many failed iterations of the same idea, the math
textbook I proudly call &#10024;minimath&#10024;. Fundamentally, it's one big
LaTeX project compiled down to a single PDF, criss-crossed with clickable links
that point you to where you need to go.

# Introducing: minimath

After no deliberation at all, I've decided to title this project "minimath"
after no one in particular. It's main components are:

- The `minimath` binary (written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)).
  - CLI interface by [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).
  - Configured with [YAML](https://yaml.org).
  - Development server (live-preview PDF builds).
  - Automatic label generation.
  - Pretty-prints `pdflatex` output.
- `texlive-small`: a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image (built on GitHub
  Actions and hosted on [GHCR][ghcr-img])
- `minimath-rg`: a [ripgrep][ripgrep]-inspired indexer.
- Build + Test + Compile PDF + Publish on GitHub Actions.
- Formatting supported with [latexindent][latexindent].

<h2 id="compile-flow">Core Compilation Flow</h2>

1. The user selects a [preset](#preset) to compile. If none is specified,
   `minimath` compiles everything.
2. Spawn a child process of `pdflatex` and keep the handle on its stdin.
3. Traverse the `*.tex` files based on the preset and write content directly to
   `pdflatex`'s stdin.
4. Write build artifacts to the `.build` directory and move the generated PDF
   file to the current working directory.

The machinery that orchestrates all of this is the `minimath` binary.

# Interacting with pdfTeX

After installing a copy/distribution of LaTeX, the simplest way to compile a PDF
from plain-source TeX is to write all your TeX into one file, say
`one-shot-job.tex`:

```tex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Khang was here.
\end{document}
```

and then run the command

```sh
pdflatex one-shot-job.tex
```

to produce a `one-shot-job.pdf` file (That example above actually works).

Now, when `pdflatex` is ran without a path as argument, it will interpret all
remaining commands as TeX input. To see how this works, try running just

```sh
pdflatex
```

It will enter a [REPL][repl] that looks like this,

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<pre class='overflow-x-hidden'>
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.26 (TeX Live 2024) (preloaded format=pdflatex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
**
</pre>

where you can start typing in what would have been the contents of
`one-shot-job.tex`. After you've done all that, the screen should look something
like this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<pre class='text-neutral-300 overflow-x-hidden'>
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.26 (TeX Live 2024) (preloaded format=pdflatex)

</pre>

and you'd find a `texput.pdf` existing in the current directory that should
match the previously generated `one-shot-job.pdf` exactly. The [core compilation
flow](#compile-flow) of `minimath` exploits this behavior of `pdflatex`.

We use Rust standard library's [Command][Command] to spawn a `pdflatex`
subprocess and keep it open as we write to its stdin. Then, instead of us typing
the contents of the `.tex` document line-by-line, we can now programmatically
send characters to the subprocess. It is through this and a strategic traversal
of all the `*.tex` files in the repository that we build the final PDF.

There's just one more thing: in the spirit of [reproducibility](#reproducible),
we've downloaded a minimal set of packages and committed them to this repository
at `.github/tex/*.sty`. But how will `pdflatex` know to look in there for TeX
packages? In the [linux documentation][pdflatex-doc], we just need to set the
`TEXINPUTS` environment variable to `.github/tex:` and we're all set.

```sh
TEXINPUTS=.github/tex: pdflatex ...
```

# <span class='font-mono' style='font-size: 0.94em;'>texlive-small</span> Docker image

As a key feature of this project is [reproducibility](#reproducible), the entire
book's PDF is built on GitHub Actions. For this, we need LaTeX. Now, none of
GitHub Action's [runner images][gh-runners] offer LaTeX pre-installed, so we
need a way to get LaTeX up and running on the CI container. _Installing_ LaTeX
every CI run not only takes significant time but also adds a layer of
uncertainty.

The initial solution was to use [`xu-cheng/latex-action`][xu-cheng-la]. It pulls
a lightweight Docker image with LaTeX installed and uses that to build the PDF.
While it's an awesome GitHub Action in its own right, the inconvenience with
this implementation is that we can only tell it to run `pdflatex` on
compile-ready `.tex` files. That is, we need to specifically export some
`main.tex` that contains _everything_ in the book, and then process that with
`pdflatex`. This breaks the [core compile flow](#compile-flow), and requires us
to implement a secondary one that will only run on CI. Having an extra compile
flow creates a separation between the PDF that's built while writing locally and
the PDF that is exported on CI runs. So while this solution works (and was _the_
solution) for a long time, I knew that I had to continue searching for a better
one.

The next solution I considered was to use the more general
[`xu-cheng/texlive-action`][xu-cheng-ta]. Instead of specifying the `*.tex`
files to compile, this now allows users to run arbitrary commands on the
container. However, that means running the `minimath` binary natively on the
container, which requires setting up Rust and _then_ building the binary there.
That's too much complexity to be running on an auxiliary container so I quickly
abandoned this direction.

Fast-forward to today's solution: _open a subprocess to the Docker container and
pipe to its stdin_. Honestly, I didn't know this was possible and I was pretty
stoked when I first got it to work.

By creating an executable file called `pdflatex.sh` with the following contents,

```sh
#!/bin/sh
docker run \
  --interactive \
  -v $PWD:/tmp \
  --workdir /tmp \
  --env TEXINPUTS \
  ghcr.io/libmath/texlive-small \
  pdflatex $@
```

we can use `pdflatex` _as if it were installed_ on the local machine, by running
`./pdflatex.sh` with the arguments normally passed to `pdflatex`. The idea being
that we link the current working directory, captured by `$PWD`, to the `/tmp`
directory in the container using the `-v` flag; the `--env` flag sends
environment variables defined in the host machine into the container; and
finally we spawn the `pdflatex` command and pass on all the arguments with `$@`.

This is _the_ current method of operation on GitHub Actions. Based on the 0-1s
pull time of the GHCR image, it seems like GHCR-hosted images are cached. Either
way, cached or not, `pdflatex` is now made available on every CI run in
effectively no time at all. The `texlive-small` image is rebuilt only once a
month to fetch the latest copy of LaTeX, but otherwise every PDF compiled in
that month uses the exact same version of LaTeX, it coming from the same image.
So now we have a way to get LaTeX installed both quickly _and_ predictably.

# Content organization

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ul class="toc">
  <li><a href="#content-hierarchy">Content hierarchy</a></li>
  <li><a href="#organizing-marks">Organizing marks</a></li>
  <li><a href="#using-minimath-rg">Using minimath-rg to search for marks</a></li>
</ul>

## Content hierarchy

The goal of [navigatability](#navigatable) demands for a careful choice in
content organization. Here's the hierarchy of content that minimath works with:

- A <b id='preset'>Preset</b> is _named_ a list of **Chapters**.
- A **Chapter** is a _named_ list of **Sections**.
- A **Section** is an _unnamed_ list of **Subsections**.
- A **Subsection** corresponds (one-to-one) to a single `.tex` file, and is a
- A <b id='mark'>Mark</b> is a Theorem/Lemma/Remark/etc.

Presets are configured in `config.yml`. These allow us to choose specific
subsets of the book to compile, so we can enjoy faster real-time preview builds.

As for why Sections are nameless: it's hard to always think of 3 layers of names
(chapter, section, subsection) while the book is still constantly evolving and
always subject to change. Hence we only name Chapters and Subsections. The role
of the Section is thus reduced to just _grouping_ similar Subsections together.

The `*.tex` files (recall that a single `*.tex` file corresponds to one
Subsection) are stored at a specific path: `<CATEGORY>/<TOPIC>/<SUBSECTION>.tex`

Hence, _every_ `*.tex` file is nested exactly 2 directories from root. This is
enforced in the tests.

The Chapter name is then hard-set as `<CATEGORY>/<TOPIC>`. Here are the
categories so far:

- **`defs`** Definitions.
- **`core`** Core stuff. One level up from definitions. Think along the lines of
  `std::` in `C`.
- **`lib`** Library stuff. Things that people might start to find useful in
  daily life, but still rigorous and general.

Putting this all together, take for example the file
`defs/linear_algebra/vector_spaces.tex`. It corresponds to exactly one
Subsection: `vector_spaces`, within the Chapter `defs/linear_algebra`. It will
contain definitions, it being in `defs`, and it is of the topic
`linear_algebra`.

## Organizing Marks

Every [mark](#mark) has a unique 7-character hash, much like a (shortened) `git`
commit hash. Naming this entity was a tough decision, but I've decided to call
it a **SHA** (backstory [here](#why-sha)).

Here's an example of a [mark](#mark) of type `Theorem` with the title `Taylor's
Theorem, k=2`, and with a SHA of `b90111f`:

```tex
\Theorem{Taylor's Theorem, k=2}\label{b90111f}
```

The contents of the theorem and its proof will follow that line. With this, we
can refer to marks by their SHA, which makes the code much cleaner than if we
were to use some serialized form of the theorem's name (e.g. `taylors-theorem`),
or an index number (e.g. `T1024` or even `T1.2.4`):

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<pre class='overflow-x-hidden'>
{'...'} By \href\{<span class='text-ac0'>b90111f</span>}\{Taylor's Theorem}, for $t>0$ there exists {'...'}
</pre>

Here's some benefits of using a SHA to look for references/definition of a mark in the codebase:

- `vim` recognizes it as a word (see: [cword][cword]) so we can search for it
  with `*` or pass it into a search function when the cursor is on any part of
  the SHA.
- It's not a real word so there will be no collisions with other text.

Now, while the index number method may look shorter at first, consider the
consequences when we want to move one particular [mark](#mark) from one chapter
to another. That's gonna be _O(n)_, ladies and gents. Instead, we stick to using
SHAs so we can refactor in _O(1)_, and sit back and let the LaTeX engine handle
the theorem numbering at PDF build-time.

> Index-numbering moves are _O(n)_ because if we move Theorem 4.1.5, we would
> have to manually rename all the marks numbered 4.1.6, 4.1.7, and so on. We
> have to repeat with the receiving end too.

Also, we can use tools like [ripgrep][ripgrep] to search the codebase for
[marks](#mark), and then fuzzy search over this catalogue. For example:

```bash
rg --type tex '^\\(Theorem|Lemma|Result).*\\label\{[a-f0-9]{7}\}'
```

This leads us into `minimath-rg`.

<h2 id="using-minimath-rg">Using minimath-rg to search for marks</h2>

`minimath-rg` exists as a standalone C binary because the project's organization
level renders [ripgrep][ripgrep]'s capabilities overkill. With just under 150
lines of C, we can traverse all `*.tex` files to look for marks.

This binary will look for lines such as this (ignore the comment, that's just
the filename):

```tex
% lib/complex_analysis/basics.tex
\Theorem{Liouville's Theorem}\label{cf6d8a9}
```

and convert this to a plain-text line

```
lib/complex_analysis/basics.tex:783:Theorem:Liouville's Theorem:cf6d8a9
```

which can now be read by [telescope][telescope] for fuzzy search, which then can
be used for navigation or obtaining the label ID quickly.

This makes writing more of the book much quicker because linking theorems can be
automated into a few keystrokes.

## Generating new SHAs

Running `minimath label` at the root of this project with automatically label
all unlabelled [marks](#mark). If it sees a line that goes

```tex
\Proposition{The empty event has probability zero}
```

It will overwrite it with

```tex
\Proposition{The empty event has probability zero}\label{a0a9280}
```

So adding new [marks](#mark) is a seamless process.

# Appendix

## Why SHA?

The 7-character hashes used to uniquely identify [marks](#mark) in the project
will be called **SHAs**. They used to be randomly generated but now we're just
hashing the timestamp at which they are created, so they are rightfully hashes.

```rust
use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher, DefaultHasher};
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};

const CHARSET: &[u8; 16] = b"abcdef0123456789";

fn random() -> [u8; 7] {
    let mut s = DefaultHasher::new();
    SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().hash(&mut s);
    let mut u: u64 = s.finish();
    std::array::from_fn(|_| CHARSET[((u % 16) as usize, u /= 16).0])
}
```

These are modelled after git's 40-character [SHA-1 hashes][git-docs-hash] to
uniquely identify commits. "40-character SHA-1 hash" is a mouthful, so the
community often call it something shorter in online discussions, often referring
to it as a hash, or more specifically, the hash of a commit. Given enough time,
some even started calling it a SHA.

- GitHub documentation refers to it as a SHA
  ([source](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)).
- GitHub Action's environment variable referring to this entity is named
  `GITHUB_SHA`
  ([source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#default-environment-variables)).
- StackOverflow discussions refer to them as SHA
  ([s1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18134627),
  [s2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18134627),
  [s3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1552353/25049714)).

I've considered calling it a `Hash` but I've decided against that because `Hash`
is already a [Rust trait][Hash]. I've rejected the idea of `Tag` because the
repository also deals with `git` tags, so there might be some confusion. `Token`
technically works, but that brings in too many external ideas tied to
authentication or even machine learning.

And so within this project, these will hereby be known as SHAs. Now if you see a
line of Rust that goes

```rust
struct SHA([u8; 7]);
```

You'd know why.
