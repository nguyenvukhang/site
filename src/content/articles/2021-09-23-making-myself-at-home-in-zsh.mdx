The thing that greets you when you open the terminal is the shell.

```
% █
```

macOS used to ship with
[bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) as the
default shell, until in [WWDC
2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features)
it was announced that [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
will replace it as the default shell.

The following snippets can either be placed inside `~/.zshrc` or be
ran directly in the z shell as commands. If you edit `~/.zshrc`, for
changes to take effect you need to either exit and reopen the
terminal, or run the command `source ~/.zshrc`.

# Aliases

For things you find yourself typing all the time.

```bash
alias zr="source ~/.zshrc"
```

After running this command, you can now type `zr` and press enter and
zsh would interpret that as if you typed `source ~/.zshrc` and pressed
enter.

Aliases can also save you a lot more keystrokes:

```bash
alias ls="ls -a --group-directories-first --color=always"
alias ll="ls -al --group-directories-first --color=always"
```

# Functions

Sometimes the one-liner nature of alias isn't enough. Or sometimes you
want to add things after the command (arguments). Functions are
perfect for this.

First of all, functions can be used just like aliases, so the alias of
`zr` is equivalent to this function:

```bash
function zr() {
  source ~/.zshrc
}
```

To pass an argument into a function, do this:

```bash
function p() {
  echo $1
}
```

The number denotes the order of the argument given. `$1` will refer to
the first argument, `$2` will refer to the second, and so on.

So if you were to run the command `p helloworld`, zsh will print out
`helloworld`, as if you typed in `echo helloworld`.

With functions you can also bring in logic like if-else statements,
for example:

```bash
function gcm() {
  if [ "$1" ]; then
    git commit -m $1
  else
    git commit
  fi
}
```

# Environment variables

Variables are called by pre-pending the `$` symbol.

```bash
FOO="bar"
echo $F00
```

Running the two commands above, you would have assigned `"bar"` to the
variable `FOO`, and the terminal will print `bar`.

Some environment variables are defined by default. One such example is
`$HOME`.

```bash
echo $HOME
```

will print the current user's home directory. For example, mine prints
`/home/khang`.

Personally, I use these variables to store key locations on my
computer, such as my main working directory and my configuration
directories

```bash
REPOS="$HOME/repos"
ZSH_DOTS="$REPOS/zsh"
```

# Splitting up your zshrc

Now this is the highlight of the article. When writing all these into
one file, namely `~/.zshrc`, things can get messy, and so it's often
better to split it up into multiple files.

I do it by putting this into my `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
ZSH_DOTS="$HOME/repos/zsh"
sourceDirs=()
[ `uname` = "Linux" ] && sourceDirs+=(linux)
[ `uname` = "Darwin" ] && sourceDirs+=(mac)
sourceDirs+=(core brew)

for d in $sourceDirs[@]; do
  fs=($(find $ZSH_DOTS/$d -type f))
  for f in $fs[@]; do
    source "$f";
  done
done
```

What this does is it finds all the files under the following
directories

```bash
~/repos/zsh/brew
~/repos/zsh/core
~/repos/zsh/linux # (only if on Linux)
~/repos/zsh/mac   # (only if on macOS)
```

And sources all of them as though they were part of `~/.zshrc`.

This has helped be organize my [zsh
configurations](https://github.com/nguyenvukhang/zsh) so much better.
Probably the best thing I've done in zsh in 2021.
