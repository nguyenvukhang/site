The first movements you should already know if you're using vim are
the <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd> keys.

It's key to first get comfortable with these before progressing to faster
moves, but if you're ready, do read on. I will be splitting this article into
three parts:

- [Vertical movements](#vertical-movements), to get you to the line you want
- [Horizontal movements](#horizontal-movements), to get you to the character you want
- [Precise movements](#precise-movements), to get straight there

Also, I will be using vimscript to describe the keys to press, so `u` simply
press <kbd>u</kbd> but `<C-u>` means press <kbd>Ctrl+u</kbd>.
`<CR>` means <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## Vertical Movements

Vertical movements get your cursor to the right general area. The first of its
kind is to simply bring you to the ends of the buffer:

- `gg` puts you at the first line
- `G` puts you at the last line

For half-page jumps, use `<C-d>` and `<C-u>`, with the length of one page being
the number of lines visible in that vim window.

- `<C-d>` moves your cursor half a page down
- `<C-u>` moves your cursor half a page up

To jump an exact number of lines, type the number of lines first, then press `j`
or `k` depending on the direction in which you wish to jump.

- `12j` puts your cursor 12 lines below its previous position
- `7k` puts your cursor 7 lines above its previous position

## Horizontal Movements

These movements are within the line you're on. The point of moving faster
horizontally is to get to the exact character you want.

- `w` puts your cursor at the first character of the next word.
- `b` puts your cursor at the first character of the current/previous word.

For more precise movements, make use of `f` and `t`. These searches for the key
you press next.

- `fr` puts your cursor exactly on the next "r" on that line. If there are no
  "r"s to the right of your cursor, it will not move.
- `td` puts your cursor one character before the next "d" on that line.

`F` and `T` function similarly, but in reverse.

- `Fr` puts your cursor exactly on the previous "r" on that line. If there are
  no "r"s to the left of your cursor, it will not move.
- `Td` puts your cursor one character to the **right** of the previous "d" on
  that line.

## Precise Movements

To get to exactly where you want immediately, use `/` or `?` and start typing your
search query.

- `/print<CR>` will bring you to the next instance of "print" in the buffer.
- `?echo<CR>` will bring you to the previous instance of "echo" in the buffer.

This is definitely the fastest way to move if you already know a word near where
you want to go.
