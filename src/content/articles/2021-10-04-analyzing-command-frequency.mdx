Every now and then I set a new alias or function to speed up my workflow within
zsh.

But sometimes when I look back at old aliases, I realise that I don't use
those anymore, and so I remove them, and at the same time I keep feeling that
there are opportunities for more aliases that I didn't know I needed.

And so I decided to track my command usage. I wanted to see which commands I was
repeating often, and create new aliases based on those.

At first, I started off writing a zsh script to run every time I ran a command,
but I remembered that zsh keeps history. All I need to do was to tap in to what
was already being logged.

So with a few extra settings in my .zshrc:

```bash
# for details, look up the man page of `zshparam`
export HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history
export HISTSIZE=1000000
export SAVEHIST=1000000

# for details, look up the man page of `zshoptions`.
setopt APPEND_HISTORY  # adds to instead of overwriting history
setopt SHARE_HISTORY  # takes commands from other instances of zsh
setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS  # remove unnecessary blanks
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME  # append command to history file immediately after execution
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY  # record command start time
```

I now have a file `~/.zsh_history` that contains all the information I need:

- time of command execution (to the second)
- command

I then format it into a .csv file which I push to my [zsh
repository](https://github.com/nguyenvukhang/zsh). To view the data, I use
Google Sheets with one cell simply containing the code

```
=IMPORTDATA("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nguyenvukhang/zsh/master/commands.csv")
```

and I can obtain a nice plot of what commands I use most often:

From here we can already see that I ran `./analyze` a lot since I started
tracking commands, and that's because I named the tracking script `analyze`.
`exit` and `gs` (alias for `git status`) are next most frequent, which makes
sense.

It will be interesting to revisit this Google Sheet in a week or month, when I
get to capture a large portion of my daily workflow.
