For a long while, I've been using Sublime Text 3 extensively. I coded
on it, took notes on it, planned events on it. I loved it because it
was one of the few apps I had where I can install extensions to
customize the look and feel of the app, but also mostly because it was
fast.

As time went by, I felt that the configuration options open to me were
not granular enough. Customization was limited to what the endpoints
which the developers left open. Documentation also lagged far behind
features.

The large letters in caps "UNREGISTERED" did not help with the
experience. $99 for a text editor also didn't make sense.

Don't get me wrong, Sublime Text 3 was a great editor, far ahead of
other editors at the time in terms of speed and modularity. But I felt
that I had to move on.

At the time, I was vaguely aware through pop culture and memes that
there are two somewhat legendary editors: Vim and Emacs. I knew that
if you googled "vi", Google would ask if you meant "emacs", and vice
versa. I also knew that they were both open-source and free to use.

So since I was indeed looking for something free and open source and
fast, I started looking at vim. And that's how I started.
