When I started out I was slow. Oh, so slow. I took far longer to accomplish the
same task in vim than I did with sublime. After all, I only knew the `hjkl`
movements and `i` and at best `a`.

Every time I crashed vim with an error in the config file I would go back to the
familiar environment of sublime to fix the problem.

I often switched back to using Sublime whenever I got burned out from trying to
recall vim keybindings.

There were times I felt like giving up on vim. I would sometimes go a day or two
without using vim at all, but somehow I just kept watching YouTube tutorials on
using vim. There seems to be this contagious common enthusiasm shared among
those YouTubers who talk about vim.

And so for the next few weeks that was my life: use vim, get tired of
remembering keybindings and being slow, switch to Sublime, but keep watching vim
videos, learn something new, switch back to vim, repeat.

As I went through this dance, I gradually began to notice that there are certain
things I can do effortlessly in vim that I cannot do in Sublime.

For example in Sublime, if I wanted to add a new line under the line I'm
currently at, I would have to move my cursor to the end of the line and press
enter.
The movement can be done either with the mouse or pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Right</kbd>.
In vim, the same is accomplished by pressing <kbd>o</kbd> from anywhere in the
line. Not having to move my hand away from my keyboard to me was a huge plus.

With each equally useful built-in function vim offers that Sublime doesn't,
coupled with better vim documentation to enable a quicker discovery of those
functions, I left Sublime for good.
