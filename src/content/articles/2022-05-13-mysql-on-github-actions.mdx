title: Running MySQL on GitHub Actions

I'm currently working on a project that relies heavily on a relational
database, and so I've found myself having to pick up MySQL in a short
span of time.

With that level of reliance also comes a minimum requirement of a
level of certainty that base-level code is correct, and so unit tests
was the obvious thing to write together with those base functions.

Local tests were easy enough; most things I could solve in a
once-and-for-all way by running a system command to fix a local MySQL
configuration or just add a script to the project. However, getting a
MySQL instance to run server-side GitHub Actions took me far longer
than whatever I've done locally, and so that's why I'm staying up an
extra hour to write this quick guide so the next person doing the
exact same thing doesn't have to go through the 50-odd failed GitHub
Action runs I had to sit through.

So let's get into it.

I know this might be skipping too far ahead, but this is my entire
working workflow file. I'll break it down and go through each bit:

<summary>Full working yaml file (this goes into `.github/workflows/cool-name.yml`)</summary>

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - dev

env:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db
  DB_USER: root
  DB_PASSWORD: root
  RESTORE: .test.sql

jobs:
  check-database-package-json-scripts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - name: üî• Initialize MySQL
        run: sudo systemctl start mysql.service

      - name: üìå Initialize first database
        run: |
          mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE ${{ env.MYSQL_DATABASE }};' \
          -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: üöÄ Boost user
        run: |
          mysql -e "ALTER USER '${{ env.DB_USER }}'@'localhost' \
          IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';" \
          -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: üç∫ Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: üß∂ Install yarn
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: üì¶ run tests
        working-directory: ./packages/database
        run: |
          MYSQL_RESTORE_SOURCE=$RESTORE \
          MYSQL_USERNAME=$DB_USER \
          MYSQL_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD \
          MYSQL_ACTIVE_DATABASE=$MYSQL_DATABASE \
          yarn test
```

</details>

# Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - dev
```

These define when the entire workflow file is run. Here, it's ran
after every time someone pushes to branches `master` or `dev`.

Note that for it to work as expected it must exist on both the
`master` and `dev` branch.

# Environment variables

```yaml
env:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db
  DB_USER: root
  DB_PASSWORD: root
  RESTORE: .test.sql
```

These are just like variables in a programming language. They store
values and can be used again later.

To refer to the environment variable `DB_USER`, we use `${{
env.DB_USER }}` in our later code.

# Commands

```yaml
jobs:
  check-database-package-json-scripts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - name: üî• Initialize MySQL
        run: sudo systemctl start mysql.service

      - name: üìå Initialize first database
        run: |
          mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE ${{ env.MYSQL_DATABASE }};' \
          -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: üöÄ Boost user
        run: |
          mysql -e "ALTER USER '${{ env.DB_USER }}'@'localhost' \
          IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';" \
          -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}

      - name: üç∫ Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: üß∂ Install yarn
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: üì¶ run tests
        working-directory: ./packages/database
        run: |
          MYSQL_RESTORE_SOURCE=$RESTORE \
          MYSQL_USERNAME=$DB_USER \
          MYSQL_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD \
          MYSQL_ACTIVE_DATABASE=$MYSQL_DATABASE \
          yarn test
```

### Jobs

Here, `jobs` is a keyword that tells the workflow handler to execute
the following lines of code.

`check-database-package-json-scripts` is a name that I chose, to label
the group of `steps` that will be ran under it.

### Runs-On

`runs-on` is a keyword that specifies to GitHub Actions what operating
system you'd like to run the workflow on. Here, I've chosen to run it
with Ubuntu 20.04 (an operating system much like MacOS and Windows,
only more modular).

### Steps

For each bullet point under steps, the contents of `run` will be
executed. The `name` is arbitrarily chosen.

`uses` is a keyword that is immediately followed by a published action
name. So for example the line that says

```yaml
- name: üç∫ Check out repository code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

will be running borrowed code from the published package [GitHub
Checkout][github-checkout].

And finally `working-directory` is a keyword that specifies, relative
to the root of your project, where you want to `run` a command from.

# Getting MySQL to work

So for the first `step`:

```yaml
- name: üî• Initialize MySQL
  run: sudo systemctl start mysql.service
```

I'm starting the MySQL service/daemon. You can have a look at GitHub's
own [Virtual Environment documentation][github-venv]. There, they
record all the available operating systems and their respective
pre-installed apps.

On Ubuntu 20.04 (my workflow [operating system of choice](#runs-on)),
MySQL does come pre-_installed_, but it doesn't come
pre-_enabled_. Quoting from [GitHub's docs][github-ubuntu]:

> MySQL service is disabled by default. Use the following command as a
> part of your job to start the service: `sudo systemctl start
mysql.service`

The next `step`:

```yaml
- name: üìå Initialize first database
  run: |
    mysql -e 'CREATE DATABASE ${{ env.MYSQL_DATABASE }};' \
    -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

is a measure I took in case the code I want to test is not resilient
enough to handle initializing a new database on MySQL.

Then the last MySQL-related step:

```yaml
- name: üöÄ Boost user
  run: |
    mysql -e "ALTER USER '${{ env.DB_USER }}'@'localhost' \
    IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';" \
    -u${{ env.DB_USER }} -p${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

Is to allow all following code that uses the existing credentials to
freely manipulate all databases within the MySQL instance.

A for-instance is that if you tried to import a `.sql` file into your
database with this shell command

```shell
mysql -u root -p"root" test_do < some_file.sql
```

Then it will complain with some [cryptic error][stackoverflow] that's
unrelated to how it's meant to be solved.

# End

And yeah. That pretty much sums up how to run a MySQL instance on
GitHub Actions. If you'd like to get a full picture of what's going
on, such as what tests I run with the last `step`, head over to the
[project's repository](https://github.com/modtree/modtree).

Notably, here's a [direct link][yaml] to the discussed yaml file.

glad to see how I can help.
