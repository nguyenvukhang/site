Most of my pre-univeristy education was spent doing math. But I
stopped after enlisting because it required too different of a state
of mind from the daily grind. After leaving the Army, I didn't quite
get straight back into math, but instead started on some coding
projects. Now, I'm back studying math full-time at university, and I
see two things which math can learn from code.

- [Variable scoping](#variable-scoping)
- [Standardizing syntax](#standardizing-syntax)

## Variable scoping

When programming something small, it's okay to name your variables
things like `x` and `y` and not be worried of names conflicting.
However, this doesn't hold in a larger project. Most programming
languages already address this. Variables can be choosed to be scoped
within a function. This leaves programmers to reuse common names even
if they were defined differently outside of the function.

Math needs this. There needs to be a more common practice to scope
variables so they remain more readable. We can't keep relying on
extending over to Greek alphabets or subscript numbers.

## Standardizing syntax

Because most of math is expressed in conjunction with a written
language, mathematical papers still leave room for misunderstanding.
Unlike a programming language which has a mechanical compiler, the
language of math is compiled by the human brain. While compilers are
identical if on the same version, and give the exact same evaluation
of the same code, this is not the case for humans and math mixed with
language.

The lack of a standardized syntax probably stems from the fact that
math was develop independently by lots of different people who speak
different native languages. There wasn't a single person or team who
constructed math in its entirety and proposed it to the world, unlike
programming languages.

Still, I'd say that one edge that math has over code is that it is
more readable for its own purpose. Fractions is one example. That they
are written on two lines makes it so much easier to visually
manipulate.

Overall, I'm still optimistic about the future of documented math
because it's still a relatively new technology when you consider how
many other things it serves as a basis for.
