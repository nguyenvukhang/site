After installing vim and having used it for a while, I built up a certain
confidence. I was ready for my next challenge.

I knew of Arch Linux from memes, actually. Everyone was making fun about how
unstable it is, how difficult it is to install, and most of all how every Arch
user has the insatiable urge to tell people that they use Arch Linux. It has
come to the point where "I use Arch btw" has become a meme of its own.

So one day in the post-conscription, pre-university boredom, I decided to wipe
my MacBook Air clean to install Arch. Just for the heck of it.

I've installed Ubuntu on my past devices before so obtaining the bootable USB
stick from the downloaded iso wasn't that hard. It was when I booted into the
USB for the first time that I encountered my first issue. The wifi driver wasn't
working. The solution wasn't ideal, but it worked: an ethernet cable dongle.

The installation process itself wasn't really all that intimidating. I followed
[DT's guide](https://youtu.be/PQgyW10xD8s)
for it. All he really did was follow the instructions already written on the
[Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide)
but having someone else do it with me, even if only on video, felt more
comforting.

While installing, I noticed there were lots of parallels to what I would usually
do on an Ubuntu install. Things like setting a default keyboard layout, defining
locales and timezones, disk partitioning and creating users. The only difference
is with Arch, everything is typed out in the terminal, rather than pointing and
clicking with your cursor.

Once done, I unplugged the USB and restarted my Mac. It booted straight back
into the terminal. No graphical user interface, no default wallpaper or icons,
nothing. Just a black terminal interface with a blinking cursor waiting for my
username.

Clean out of the boxâ€”just the way I like it.
