A big reason why I chose to buy my keyboard is because it is compatible with the
[qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) software. With this, I can define my
own keyboard shortcuts and attach them to really specific functions.

## Fuzzy PDF Finder

Mostly, my university assignments are given to me in PDF form. While I try my
best to organize them well, I always felt that finding and opening them took
more keystrokes than was necessary. So I made this.

When I hit <kbd>Cmd + p</kbd>, a menu which lists all the PDFs on my computer
pops up at the center of my screen:

So let's say I want to open a this particular file:

```
.../modules/MA1100/pdfs/tutorial-sets/ts-5.pdf
```

I would only need to type `m1ts5` for it to be found.

Found and open in less than 10 keystrokes.

## App Launcher

Launching apps fast is always important, since that's the main purpose of a
computer. What I have here you can think of this as a lighter, faster version of
macOS's Spotlight search: it's davatorium's
[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi). I launch it exactly how macOS
launches Spotlight: with <kbd>Cmd + Space</kbd>.

It learns which apps you launch most often pretty fast. Usually I only need to
type two letters before what's in mind is the top suggestion.
