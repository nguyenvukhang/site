When I was done installing Arch, all I had was a terminal. No desktop, no
wallpaper, no icons, nothing. It wasn't even a single window with a terminal.
The computer was the terminal. That's what I logged in to.

Turns out, there's a lot to install just to get close to how things were back on
macOS. But first, I was tired to googling for solutions on my phone, so I wanted
to get an internet browser up and running on my desktop.

Installing firefox wasn't enough. I also had to install a display server and a
window manager—already two things I didn't know I needed to have installed. I
still don't know what a display server does exactly. I think of it as the bridge
between the terminal and graphical user interface (GUI). Apps like vim and emacs
run in the terminal just fine, but to view photos or play videos, you would need
a display manager. A window manager then manages how windows are places
on-screen.

The actual installation process is very quick and easy, and I think that's one
of Arch's best features. All you have to do is type

```
sudo pacman -S firefox xorg xorg-xinit awesome
```

into the terminal and hit enter. This installs

- firefox,
- xorg (the display server, along with its initializer `xorg-xinit`),
- and awesome window manager.

I actually unknowingly made the more difficult choice of xmonad as my first
window manager, but that's a story for another day. Let's stick with Awesome for
now.

Also, since I had an Intel CPU, I also added Intel's video driver package:

```
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
```

With that, I can now fire up my window manager atop a display server by first
creating a file `~/.xinitrc` which contains a single line:

```
exec /usr/bin/awesome  # launches awesome
```

and then running the command

```
startx
```

At this point, I have now progressed on to an actual desktop complete with a
wallpaper, and by default I can press <kbd>Cmd+p</kbd> (<kbd>Win+p</kbd> for
other PCs) to open Awesome's built-in app launcher, from which I can type
"firefox" and press enter to finally launch Firefox.

And that's just Firefox. In this process, I already got to know that operating
systems can be broken down to finer components than I previously thought
possible. On one hand it's daunting to have to install everything down to even
the driver, but with it came a sense of peace—that nothing is installed on my
device unless I want it to be.
