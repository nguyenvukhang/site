Over the holidays I've decided to give [GNU's stow][stow-home] a real
try. And I think I'll never go back to my previous setup again. I now
believe that this is the new best way of managing configuration files.

I used to write shell scripts to manage symlinks so I could store my
config files in git projects. This was nice because I could track
progress but after a while it was a lot of mental overhead to remember
what belongs where.

With stow, here's what my dotfile repository looks like:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── .gitmodules
├── nvim
│  └── .config
│     └── nvim
│        ├── init.lua
│        ├── lua
│        └── vim
├── personal
│  ├── .config
│  │  └── nvim
│  │     ├── colors
│  │     ├── data
│  │     └── ultisnips
│  └── .local
│     └── bin
└── zsh
   ├── .zshenv
   └── .zshrc
```

Within each folder in the root directory, it's how my entire home
directory would look like if all I had were config files.

So if I ran

```
stow --target $HOME nvim
```

then it will create symlinks required to achieve this file tree:

```
~
└── .config
   └── nvim
      ├── init.lua
      ├── lua
      └── vim
```

which means that my nvim configs will be installed exactly where they
need to be.

Well actually with basic symlink management it's not that hard to
manually achieve this. But here's the awesome thing that stow can do:

If I went on to run

```
stow --target $HOME personal
```

then stow will realize that there is a conflict under the
`~/.config/nvim` folder and automatically manage it, creating this
file tree:

```
~
├── .config
│  └── nvim
│     ├── init.lua
│     ├── lua
│     ├── vim
│     ├── colors
│     ├── data
│     └── ultisnips
└── .local
   └── bin
```

This is great because now I can store my personal nvim configs outside
of my public nvim repository, and still have it all install properly
with stow.

That's how my recent [dots][dots-repo] repository came to be, with an
extensive use of git submodules to pull configs in from different
repositories, some public and others private.
