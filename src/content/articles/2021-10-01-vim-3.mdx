There are two main modes in which you will be in vim: Normal and Insert. Most of
your movement will be done in Normal mode, and your editing in Insert. In this
post I will be talking about different ways of entering and exiting Insert mode.

# Entering Insert Mode

First off: your standard ways of entering Insert mode: <kbd>i</kbd> (insert)
and <kbd>a</kbd> (append). <kbd>i</kbd> lets you start inserting text to the
left of the character you were previously on, while <kbd>a</kbd> puts you on the
right of the character you were on. <kbd>a</kbd> is useful when you want to
append text to the end of the line.

The following methods will allow you to slip into Insert mode so fast you
won't even realise it. Get used to these, and you're in for some real speed.

### o

So next, we have <kbd>o</kbd>. This key alone is a big reason why I find it so hard
to go back to a point-and-click text editor. With your cursor anywhere on a line
in Normal mode, pressing <kbd>o</kbd> will create a new line under that,
properly indented, and put you in Insert mode. From anywhere in the line! You
no longer have to go to the end and press enter. Just go to the line,
press <kbd>o</kbd>, and you're good to go.

### Upper case

Now all of these keys have their upper case versions. <kbd>I</kbd> puts you in
Insert mode to the left of the first character of that line, and <kbd>A</kbd>
puts you in Insert mode to the right of the last character of that line. This is
useful when you want to pre-pend or append things to the whole line.

And <kbd>O</kbd> does the same thing as <kbd>o</kbd>, except it's on the line
above.

### c is for change

The next big thing is <kbd>c</kbd>. Let's say you want to change a word with
another word. You would first go to the front of the word, press `dw` to delete
the word, then press `i` and type in the new word. With <kbd>c</kbd>, you can
press `cw` and accomplish the same task as `dwi`. I remember `cw` as "change
word." The neat thing is: you can pair <kbd>c</kbd> with any verbs!

- `ciw` will change the word your cursor is on (doesn't need to be at the front)
- `ci'` will delete the text inside single quotes and put you in Insert mode.
- `ca(` will delete the text inside the parentheses, including the parentheses,
  and put you in Insert mode.

(you can think of `ci` as "change in something" and `ca` as "change around
something")

# Exiting Insert Mode

The first way is to simply press <kbd>Esc</kbd>. It's rather far off the home
row so I remapped my caps lock key to send escape instead, so exiting Insert
mode for me is a well within reach of my left little finger.

Another way is to remap a specific combination of keystrokes to exit Insert
mode. A common choice is `jk` because it's right on the home row. This can be
done by adding this to your vimrc or init.vim:

```
inoremap jk <Esc>
```

This method saves the trouble of having to remap the caps lock key, or having to
reach to the top-left of the board to exit Insert mode. It is also safe to press
in Normal mode because it brings the cursor down then up, landing you back where
you started.

`jk`
