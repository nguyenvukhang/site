I grew up learning how to type on the standard QWERTY layout, which
looked something like this:

But I realised that typing on such a keyboard forces your hands to be
very close to each other. This in turn makes you tend to hunch over
your keyboard or roll your shoulders inwards when you type.

So in pursuit of ergonomics and also largely due to the cool factor, I
bought myself a split keyboard. A split keyboard is a two-piece
keyboard, so you can place the two halves as far away from each other
as you want. This way, you can have each hand at their natural resting
position of shoulder-width apart.

In particular, I got the [Iris
model](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard).
Apart from being a split keyboard, it also slightly realigned the keys
such that they were in-line vertically while staggered horizontally
such that the home row follows the natural curve of your fingers.

I had to relearn a lot of finger movements in this new layout. For
one, I used to hit <kbd>B</kbd> with my right hand, but now I'm forced
to use my left hand. I also used to hit <kbd>C</kbd> with by left
index, but now I have to mentally remap that to my left middle finger.

Not to mention it has less keys than a normal keyboard, so symbols
like <kbd>[</kbd>, <kbd>]</kbd>, <kbd>{'{'}</kbd>, and <kbd>}</kbd>
had to be binded to chords (with my custom modifier at the right
thumb: <kbd>↑</kbd>).

So to type braces on my keyboard, I needed to do these:

- to get <kbd>[</kbd>, I press <kbd>↑ + o</kbd>.
- to get <kbd>]</kbd>, I press <kbd>↑ + p</kbd>.
- to get <kbd>{'{'}</kbd>, I press <kbd>↑ + Shift + o</kbd>.
- to get <kbd>}</kbd>, I press <kbd>↑ + Shift + p</kbd>.

To program the keyboard, I use
[qmk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). It grants me full control
over the keyboard, so I can do my own cool stuff like press a special
key combination to play some epic music track or something.

Notice how I don't have an enter key where it is commonly placed. I
mapped the <kbd>Pg Dn</kbd> key at my left thumb to enter. This has
given my formerly useless left thumb a new purpose, and I've found
this one of the most pleasing changes. My keyboard layout is
[open-source][keymap], so feel free to check it out and make it your
own.

I really enjoy the reduced hand movement as a result of the keys all
being closer to the home row, coupled with the greater engagement of
the thumbs. While it took some time to get used to, learning this new
layout has been a rewarding experience. I got more familiar with where
each key is, thanks to the more organized layout, and I can type
faster on this than on a standard keyboard now.
